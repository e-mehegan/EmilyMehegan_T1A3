# Terminal Application

## <b><u>Code Styling</b></u>

### <ul><u>Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to</ul></u>

The style guide that was followed through the creation of the application was PEP8. Multiple styling conventions where used to ensure that the code was easy to understand and read for all users. These style conventions with the PEP8 style guide include:

<br>
<br>

<u>DOCSTRINGS AND COMMENTS</u>

- Docstrings have been used through-out the whole application in order to explain and break down what the functions of the applications do. It also assists users of what the functions are needed for, in order for the application to run smoothly. 
- Comments are used to aid in describing the functions and what they do. Further aiding the user of the applications functionality

<br>

<u>CODE LAY-OUT</u>

- Many code-styling elements have been implemented in the lay-out to ensure readability and understanding. These include blank lines, space indentation, imports and wrapped lines. These are the ones that are used the most in the code lay-out.
- Indentation of four spaces is used to help readability.
- Imports are located at the top of the files and separated. This means they are easily seen and helps organise the file.
- Lines are wrapped if they are over 79 characters to help improve with readability and organisation.
- Blank lines are used to help create separation between different functions which aid in organisation and readability of the file.

<br>

<u>WHITESPACE</u>

- Whitespace is avoided through-out to improve readability and prevent errors.

<br>

<u>NAMING CONVENTIONS</u>
- Naming conventions are followed to ensure that the code is understandable and readable. Making sure that function and variable names are in lower case and separated by underscores if need be.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## <u><b>Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature</b></u>

<br>

### <u><b>CONTACT MENU</u></b>

The contact menu is created in an easy way for the user to input a number from 1 to 5 for whatever task they wish to do in the contact book. 

The user is prompted to enter a number from the number options. The return statement will return the user's input choice, which is then stored in the user choice variable. This local varible is only assigned in the while loop, and is used to determine whether the application will continue to loop or exit, depending on the user input. It will determine which function the application will execute based on the user's input number choice. This will bring the user to thier choosen function which will then play out.

The while loop will continue to bring the user back to the contact menu once it has finish the chosen function. This will only stop unbtil the user chooses to exit the program by choosing '5'

```
def contact_menu():
    print(f"Enter {fg('69')}1{attr('reset')} to {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}view{attr('reset')} Contact Book")
    print(f"Enter {fg('69')}2{attr('reset')} to {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}add{attr('reset')} new contact")
    print(f"Enter {fg('69')}3{attr('reset')} to {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}delete{attr('reset')} a contact")
    print(f"Enter {fg('69')}4{attr('reset')} to {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}edit{attr('reset')} a contact")
    print(f"Enter {fg('69')}5{attr('reset')} to {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}exit{attr('reset')} the Contact Book")
    """Asks for user choice and will go to user choice and carry out that function"""
    choice = input(f"Enter your {fg('69')}{attr('underlined')}number{attr('reset')} choice!: ")
    return choice


user_choice = ""

while user_choice != "5":
    user_choice = contact_menu()

    if (user_choice == "1"):
        view_contact(file_name)
    elif (user_choice == "2"):
        add_contact(file_name)
    elif (user_choice == "3"):
        delete_contact(file_name)
    elif (user_choice == "4"):
        edit_contact(file_name)
    elif (user_choice == "5"):
        continue
    else:
        print(f"Sorry! {fg('9')}Invaild input{attr('reset')}")
```
<br>

### <b><u>ERROR HANDLING CONTACT MENU</b></u>

<br>

- To handle any errors, if the user choses an input that is not used, it will output a message that states "Sorry! Invalid Input", prompting them to press enter. This will return them to the contact menu. This will continue to loop back to the contact menu until the user chooses a vaild input.

<br>
<br>

### <b><u>FUNCTIONS</b></u>

<br>

The main features of the application are separated into files, one called 'contact_functions.py' and 'edit_contact_function.py'. This is used to organise the files and to ensure that they are not cluttered in the 'main.py' file. The 'contact_functions.py' and 'edit_contact_function.py' is imported into the 'main.py' to successfully run the application. The edit contact function is separted into its own file since it is bigger than the other functions.

All the functions have the 'file_name' variable is used through-out the applications code.  This is used to create the 'contact_file' and is used to check if this file already exists, if not it will create a new file. This will be stored in the 'file_name', which will then wirte the header row for the file. The varibale names are given in a way that is easy to identify there purpose.

```
from contact_functions import view_contact, add_contact, delete_contact
from edit_contact_function import edit_contact
```

### <b><u>ERROR HANDLING</b></u>

<br>

- In the try block, it will check if the contact list file is already created by opening the file in read mode. If it does open, it will skip creating the file and move onto executing the contact menu function. 

- To avoid the file not found error, if the file doesn't exist the except statement will create a new file. The file will be used to store the contact book information in the 'file_name' variable. This will then open the file and wirte the 'Contacts, Address and phone' heading in a row. This is used done through the write() function. The file is then closed. 

- Without the try and except blocks the program will run into an error and terminate the program without running through any of the functions.

CODE SNIPPIT BELOW:

```
file_name = "contact_list.csv"

try:
    contact_file = open(file_name, "r")
    contact_file.close()

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    contact_file = open(file_name, "w")
    contact_file.write("CONTACTS,ADDRESS,PHONE\n")
    contact_file.close()
```

<br>
	
#### <u>VIEW CONTACT BOOK</u>

View contact book code snippt

- The 'View Contact Book' function prints out the contact information in a row for the viewer. This is presented as the name, address and phone number of the contact. This function opens the contact file in read mode then prints the information in the file in the form of a row for the user. This is structured so the the titles that are printed in a row are not numbered, only the contacts will be.

<br>

#### <u>ADD NEW CONTACT</u>

view new contact codesnippt

- The 'Add New Contact' feature asks for input from the user. It will first ask for the name of the new contact, then the address and phone number. This then opens the contact file in append mode which adds this new information to the contact file in there prospected locations.  

<br>

#### <u>DELETE CONTACT</u>

Delete Contact Codesnippit

- The 'Delete Contact" function asks for the name of the contact that the user wished to delete. This will then read the names in the existing contact file and save the data in the file except for the data on the name that they wish to delete. The function will then carry out this deletion and print the appended list of contact names for the user to view. This confirms that the contact and all its information was deleted. The updated file is then written into the file through write mode.
	
ERROR HANDLING: Case sensitive lower case is used

<br>

#### <u>EDIT CONTACT</u>

view edit code snippit

- features

<br>

#### <u>EXIT CONTACT BOOK</u>

- The 'Exit Contact Book' feature allows the user to just enter the number '5' which will then close the application. This is done through a looping function and the continue statement. 
	INCLUDE CODE SNIPPIT

- The continue statement makes sure to exit the current loop in the contact menu and move to the next loop. Since the 'user_choice !=5' is not fulfilled the program will break the loop and exit. This is confirmed through the use of the print statement "Closing Contact Bookâ€¦ CLOSED" to confirm to the user that they have successfully closed the application.
